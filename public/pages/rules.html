<h1>1. Season Structure</h1>
	<h2>1.1. </h2>

<h1>2. Match Structure</h1>
	<h2>2.1. Match Times</h2>
		<h3>2.1.1. Deadline</h3>
			<div>
				<b>Score reporting:</b> Friday - 11:59PM AEST<br />
				<b>Schedule release:</b> Friday night - Saturday morning<br />
				<b>Complete negotiations:</b> Sunday - 11:59PM AEST
			</div>
		<h3>2.1.2. Mediation</h3>

	<h2>2.2. Recording</h2>
		<div>
			<p>2.2.1. All matches must be recorded with a demo from each player's perspective</p>
			<p>2.2.2. These demos may be requested by a league admin at any time.</p>
		</div>

	<h2>2.3. Spectators</h2>
		<div>
			<p>2.3.1. Only league admins may spectate matches from within the game server</p>
			<p>2.3.2. STV servers will be made available upon request</p>
		</div>

	<h2>2.4. Pausing</h2>
		<div>
			<p>2.4.1. Maximum 5 minutes, twice a match per team</p>
		</div>

	<h2>2.5. Mercs</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				A player <b>not</b> rostered, but used instead of an <b>unavailable</b> team member is considered a mercenary. Eligible mercenaries require a <b>Qixalite league account</b> and no <b>active punishments</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A maximum of <b>two</b> mercenaries are allowed, but merc usage is limited to <b>four</b> matches per season and a team is restricted to use an individual player <b>twice</b> as a merc per season.
			</p>
			<p>
				Message the <b>SteamID</b> and <b>Qixalite league account</b> to a member of the staff team; this will begin the process to <b>authorise</b> the player for the match. Submitting mercenary requests with players that are in a <b>higher</b> skill bracket, will result in the request being <b>denied</b>.
			</p>
			<p>Approved requests will require you to post the <b>SteamID</b> and <b>Qixalite league account</b> in the appropriate match thread. Failing to follow this process could lead to a <b>mercenary ban</b> for your team.

	<h2>2.6. Forfeits</h2>
		<h3>2.6.1. Win / Loss</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Rule breaches during an official game and no contact or attempts to organise the match will result in a forfeit win  to the victim team. Furthermore, both teams will have a maximum of 15 minutes past the agreed upon time to be readied.
				</p>
				<p>
					Server organisation is at the fault of both teams, but is expected that the home team setup and send the server details to the away team. However, if this has not happened, the away team must book a server and try to provide server details. Similarly, the home team will have 15 minutes past to join the server or provide server details.

				</p>
				<p>
					Forfeit wins require chat logs or evidence suggesting an intent to organise the match, but with no communication back from the other team. Post all evidence into the match thread when submitting the result.
				</p>
				<p>
					A forfeit loss will count towards a forfeit punishment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Point Amount:</b> 4
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3>2.6.2. Mutual</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Instances where both teams have not organised or come to an agreement on the match times by <b>Monday 11:59 PM - AEST</b> will result in a mutual forfeit. Addition to this, if no scores have been submitted by either team, the match will also result in a mutual forfeit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The exception to the rule is if both teams have contacted staff in regards to match organisational difficulties, then match negotiations will be extended at the discretion of the the staff team. However, if mediation is required a staff member will decide to force a time where both teams will have the best chances to field as many players as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					A mutual forfeit will count towards a forfeit punishment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Point Amount:</b> 0
				</p>
			</div>

		<h3>2.6.3. Technical</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					Issues resulting in the inability for both teams being able to play the match will result in a technical forfeit.  Such instances that could occur would be widespread power outages, steam outages and server booking issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					A technical forfeit will <b>not</b> count towards a forfeit punishment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Point Amount:</b> 2
				</p>
			</div>
